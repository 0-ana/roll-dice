## Game Rules

- Players take turns to roll a single die as many times as they wish
- Each roll adds the result to the player's turn total
- If a player rolls a 1, their turn total becomes 0, and their turn ends
- A player can choose to 'hold' their turn total, adding it to their overall score, and pass the turn to the next player
- The first player to reach or exceed 100 points wins the game

## How to Play

- Players take turns rolling the die. After each roll, they can choose to roll again or hold their score
